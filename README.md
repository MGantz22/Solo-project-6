# _Currency Exchange_


#### By _Mitchell Gantz_

#### _A code review project for basic API setup and calls._

## Technologies Used

- _JavaScript_
- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Webpack_
- _eslint_
- _babel_
- _API_


## Description/Objectives

-_A user should be able to enter an amount (in U.S. dollars), then specify another currency (such as the South Korean won), and submit a form. The user should then see the total amount they entered in converted currency._
-_Users should be able to convert U.S. currency into at least 5 other types of currency_.
-_If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification to the user that states what the error is. (That means the error should show up in the DOM, not in the console.)_
-_If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist. (Note: Even if you use a dropdown menu to specify currencies instead of a form field, you'll still need to add this functionality to your code.)_
